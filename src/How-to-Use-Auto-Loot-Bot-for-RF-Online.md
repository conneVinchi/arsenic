RF Online is a sci-fi and fantasy MMORPG that was released in 2004 by CCR Inc. The game is set on the planet of Novus, where three factions compete for resources and territory: the Bellato Union, the Cora Holy Alliance, and the Accretia Empire. Each faction has its own unique races, classes, skills, and technologies. The game features a variety of gameplay modes, such as quests, dungeons, raids, PvP battles, and wars.
 
One of the main attractions of RF Online is the Chip War, a large-scale war that occurs every eight hours between the three factions. The objective of the war is to destroy the enemy's mining chip, which is located in their base. The faction that destroys the most chips or has the most points at the end of the war wins. The winning faction gains control of the Core Mine, a valuable resource that can be used to craft powerful items and weapons.
 
Another feature of RF Online is the MAU (Massive Armor Unit), a giant robot that can be piloted by Bellato players. The MAU can deal massive damage and withstand heavy attacks, making it a formidable force in combat. However, the MAU also consumes a lot of fuel and requires maintenance and repair. The other factions have their own advantages as well. The Cora can summon powerful animus creatures that can assist them in battle, while the Accretia can use various launchers and cannons to unleash devastating firepower.
